It took me a while to get a proper handle on using inodes.
Learned how to read inodes and how to traverse through directories and subdirectories, we explored the functionality of the inbuilt linux command ls
which prints files existing inside a directory.
A new feature would be to allow LS to divide files within different groups and print them in different columns thereafter.
